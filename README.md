# ToDo List

On the site you may add tasks, edit them by clicking on them, set their status to Completed, once they are done, and delete them via the bin icon next to them. 

All of the information is kept in the local storage on the browser via key-pair values (id, status and task name of the tasks). 

I separated the JavaScript functions related to the management of the tasks in a separate file, called taskService.js, and I am managing the changes on the task list via Event Listeners. 

## Installation

Just open the index.html on your browser.
