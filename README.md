# ToDo List

On the site you may add tasks, edit them by clicking on them, set their status to Completed, once they are done, and delete them via the bin icon next to them. 

If you want to clear all of the tasks there is also a button just above the Task List.

All of the information is kept in the local storage on the browser via key-pair values (id, status and task name of the tasks). 

I separated the JavaScript functions related to the management of the tasks in a separate file, called taskService.js, and I am managing the changes on the task list via Event Listeners. 

## Installation

Just open the index.html on your browser and ensure that JavaScript is working properly on the browser.

## Usage

1. To add a task use the Enter Your Task field
2. To edit any task click on it and then hit enter or click elsewhere
3. To mark taks as Complete click on the Status column or on the check icon in the Actions column
4. To delete a task click on the bin icon in the Actions column
5. To delete all of the tasks click on the bin icon above the task list
